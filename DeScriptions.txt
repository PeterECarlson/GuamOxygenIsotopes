covington_model.py
	Broken. Needs module phreeqpy.
data_processing.py
	Broken. Needs module phreeqpy.
database_create.py
	Broken. Calls to hard-coded non-existant path: Guam Database SQLite **CW knows location of 'guam_groundwater.db'
diff_test.py
	Broken. Seems to be part of a larger piece of code I've seen elsewhere: "doot Mr. skeletal..."
dreybrodt.py (created May 12, 2016)
	Fixed. Models calcite growth rate
growth_rate_model.py (created Jan 3, 2017)
	Broken. Needs phreeqpy

		diurnal Jan and Monthly surface temperature
handle_dupes_function.py
	Works
handle_replicates_function.py
	Works.
isodat_gb_process.py
	Maybe broken.? I think it's supposed to plot.
map_figure.py
	Broken. Program is adapted from: https://gist.github.com/jdherman/7c06334acbc18e2a47bc. My guess is that this never worked and was abandoned.
map_plot.py
	Works. Plots DJF and JJA wind dir and precip (Noronha et al., 2017, Fig. 1)
merge_data.py
	Broken for now. reset_index issue.
microstation.py
	Broken path. Writes SQL lines for microstation data. Works in Desktop/cave logger data/microstation
monitoring_paper.py
	Plots:
		1000ln(alpha) v. 1000/T
		pCO2 and departure from equilibrium time-series
monitoring_paper_clean.py
	Seems to be broken.
my_functions.py
	Contains function "plot_all" Called by lots of things
paper_figures.py
	Plots drip rates for Flatman, Station 1, Station 2, Stumpy, 2009-2017
plotly_alpha_fig.py
	Broken. Plotting using online tool Plot.ly, which requires an account. Supposed to plot 1000lnalpha versus 1000/K for Jinapsan and other cave calcite results
scratch_20150804.py
	Broken. Tries to read nonexistant file: "alk_list.csv)
speleo_psm.py
	Broken. Needs module(?!?!) O18EVA_MEAN
test_prob.py
	Handles dupes and replicates.
Untitled.py
	Broken. Points to path Desktop/Cave Logger Data/CO2
untitled0.py
	Broken. Missing data file. (For UC Mexus 2016 proposal?)
vers_check.py
	Broken. Same issues as monitoring_paper and monitoring_paper_clean?
watkins_test.py
	Works. Does...something. Maybe to do with modeling growth rate? I think it's testing for missing data.

	Plots:
		Cave pCO2 + Cave air pressure timeseries
